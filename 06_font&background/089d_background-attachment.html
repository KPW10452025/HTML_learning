        <div class="box2">streets in protest. They were angry not just about the election but also about corrup­ tion and deteriorating security. Many cheered a coup led by Colonel Assimi Goïta in August of that year. Although he prom­ ised to hold elections within 18 months and appointed a civilian as interim presi­ dent, he soon changed his mind and used a second coup in May this year to install himself in the top job.Choguel Maïga, his civilian prime min­ ister, recently said that elections promised for February could be delayed by “a few months”. It will probably be much longer. “Elections have given us what for 30 years? Endemic corruption, lethargy and nepo­ tism,” says Oumarou Diarra, a former imam who is now in the government. The putschists claim they need more time to “refound” the state after years of corrup­ tion and bad government. Many Malians believe them. A poll of Bamako residents in September found that 75% wanted the elections postponed.General Marc Conruyt, who recently commanded French forces in the region, argues that “the political upheaval and po­ litical diﬃculties in Bamako had a very, ve­ ry limited impact” on military operations. But that may not last. To rally support for a much longer transition, Mali’s interim government has repeatedly blamed France for the country’s woes. Mr Maïga recently claimed, absurdly, that France is training jihadists. Yet he also complained about France closing some bases and about its plans to withdraw almost half of its troops.Complicating matters further are Mali’s plans to hire Wagner Group, a Russian mercenary outﬁt. “When you call a doctor [because]...your ﬁngers hurt but now your whole arm is missing,” says Mr Diarra, “you should change doctor.” Yet this is a dangerous game, especially as Mr Goïta would probably prefer France to stay de­ spite his government’s taunts. Florence Parly, the French defence minister, warns that her country “will not be able to cohabit with mercenaries” if Wagner deploys.</div>
